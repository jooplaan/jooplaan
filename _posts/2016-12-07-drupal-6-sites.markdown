Using the “FG Drupal to WordPress” Wordpress plugin FG Drupal to WordPress, it is easy to migrate your Drupal site to WordPress in one click.

<h2 class="subheader">Situation</h2>

A few years ago, I took over some clients from a developer. The websites of these people were using Drupal 6. The people were happy with their sites and didn't push for a change. They just needed some support to keep their websites updated with the latest security updates. And that was what I did, only security updates, bugfixes, and support using the CMS.

Then, Drupal 8 was released, and support for Drupal 6 went away. We had to act. There is an initiative to keep supporting Drupal 6 websites, but we all know this is not sustainable.

I decided it was best, for these websites -which are small, personal websites- to move to Wordpress. After some research, I decided to buy the Wordpress plugin “<a href="https://www.fredericgilles.net/fg-drupal-to-wordpress/">FG Drupal to WordPress</a>” from  Frederic Gilles.

<h2 class="subheader">Features of the paid Premium version</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Compatible with Drupal 6, 7 and 8</li>

  <li>Migrate the tags</li>
  <li>Migrate the basic pages</li>
  <li>Migrate the articles</li>
  <li>Migrate the images</li>
  <li>Migrate the external images</li>
  <li>Set the first image imported as featured image</li>
  <li>Migrate the comments</li>
  <li>Migrate the authors</li>
  <li>Migrate the administrators</li>
  <li>Migrate the users</li>
  <li>Authenticate the users with their Drupal passwords</li>
  <li>Migrates the custom post types</li>
  <li>Migrates the custom taxonomies</li>
  <li>Migrates the custom fields</li>
  <li>Migrates the nodes relationships</li>
  <li>Migrates the attachments</li>
  <li>SEO: Redirects the Drupal URLs to the corresponding WordPress URLs</li>
  <li>Ability to import or not import some specific node types</li>
  <li>Lifetime license</li>
  <li>Multiple imports</li>
</ul>

When you buy the plugin, you get three months of updates. I encountered one problem with importing the images from CCK fields, emailed for support, and received an answer and a fix within a few days. Great support!

<h2 class="subheader">Feature request</h2>

One thing that would be a great addition to the plugin: multilanguage support. I put in a feature request for the plugin to support WPML, the most used plugin for Wordpress for multilingual support. Frederic Gilles put it on his backlog. If you have a Drupal multilingual website that you would like to move to Wordpress, please <a href="https://www.fredericgilles.net/support/">let Frederic know</a>, so he knows there is a bigger need out there, and his work is valuable for more.

<h2 class="subheader">No more Drupal?</h2>

Did I stop using Drupal? No! I still have a few clients using Drupal 7, and I am keeping my eye out for a project to use Drupal 8. Particularly, I would love to work with <a href="https://www.getopensocial.com/">the Open Social distribution</a> initiative; this looks very interesting.
