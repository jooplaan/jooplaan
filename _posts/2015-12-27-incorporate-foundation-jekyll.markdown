Having fun throwing [Foundation for Sites](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html) and [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) in the mix for this website development.

<em>Foundation for Sites</em> claims to be the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world. The latest version is leaner. It has many improvements over the previous version, one of which is that you only include from the framework what you need in your site, which improves page load speed.

<em>BrowserSync</em> is used for time-saving synchronised browser testing. When developing for different screen sizes, this is an indispensable test assistant. Especially with the [xip.io](http://xip.io/) option enabled: live reload accross multiple devices! Change something in the Javascript or Sass/Css style, save it â€“and watch the change automagically on all your devices.

<h2 class="subheader">Also..</h2>

Started to use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) for continuous integration. For public projects on Github it is free, which is great.

With all this in place, I feel I am ready to start designing the [Work section](/work/) on this site. Before you will see any projects, I will

* Go through the projects I worked on the last 5 years
* Check which projects (show skills that) are interesting to share
* Find a pattern or patterns the can help decide on structure
* Decide on projects overview page structure
* Decide on project page structure
* Start designing!
