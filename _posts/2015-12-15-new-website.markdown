description: Yet another website (again?)
---
In 1997 I build my first website. I took the HTML source from the homepage of XS4ALL, my internet provider at the time. The Internet Archive still has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980210114416/http://www.xs4all.nl/">a copy of that site</a>.

One of the greatest things of the web then and now: View source. Look at the source of something someone created and learn. One of the major factors of the success of the Open Source movement.

The first website was HTML only. CSS didn't exist yet. All design was done in HTML, positioning with tables. Remember those days? The second website was using a self made Content Managment System. The third one was using <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>. The fourth one was using <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>. The fifth Wordpress again, the sixth a <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/headless-drupal">headless Drupal</a> instance with an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> front end. It became more and more complex.

I decided to make it simple again. This website is made using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for simple, blog-aware, static sites. The website is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/jooplaan/jooplaan.github.io">Github</a>. You can fetch a copy of the complete source from there, if you like. :)
