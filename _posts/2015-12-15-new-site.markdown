description: Yet Another Website Again
---
In 1997 I build my first website. I took the HTML source from the homepage of XS4ALL, my internet provider at the time. The Internet Archive still has a copy of that site:
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980210114416/http://www.xs4all.nl/">https://web.archive.org/web/19980210114416/http://www.xs4all.nl/</a>. One of the greatest things of the web: View source. Look at the source of something someone created and learn.
